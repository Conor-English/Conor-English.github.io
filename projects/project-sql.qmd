# 🧠 Overview

In this project, I demonstrate the use of **SQL** alongside **Python** using `sqlite3` and `pandas`.

This integration allows for efficient data querying and analysis directly from relational databases.

# 🔍 Setup and SQL Queries

```{python}
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

# Create an in-memory SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")

# Create table
conn.execute("""
CREATE TABLE players (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    goals INTEGER,
    assists INTEGER
);
""")

# Insert data
conn.executemany("INSERT INTO players (name, goals, assists) VALUES (?, ?, ?);", [
    ('Alice', 10, 3),
    ('Bob', 7, 5),
    ('Charlie', 2, 8)
])

# Query players with more than 5 goals
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM players WHERE goals > 5;", conn)
df
