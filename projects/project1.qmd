# Overview
In this project, I analyzed real-world datasets using **Python** and **Pandas** to extract meaningful insights.

# Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning
- Data Manipulation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Key Code Example

```{python}
# Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load sample data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "A": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    "B": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
})

# Basic summary
summary = df.describe()
summary
