    "text": "👋 About Me\nMy name is Conor English, and I’m a Business Studies student with a strong focus on analytics. I’m passionate about working as a data analyst in elite sports environments, particularly in player recruitment for professional teams in football, the NFL, or the NBA. I created this e-portfolio to showcase my capabilities across data analysis, machine learning, dashboarding, and SQL-driven insights, all applied through realistic, industry-inspired scenarios.\n\n\n🎓 Academic & Technical Background\nI’m studying Business Studies at Dublin City University with a specialism in Analytics, where I’ve completed modules in machine learning, data management, and statistical modeling. In addition to my degree, I’ve earned multiple certifications in Python, Machine Learning, and SQL through DataCamp and Kubicle.\n\n🧰 Tool Proficiencies\nPython SQL Jupyter Power BI Excel Matplotlib Seaborn Git VS Code Quarto\n\n\n\n🎯 Career Goals\nMy ultimate aim is to contribute to data-driven decision-making in professional sports, particularly focusing on identifying undervalued and emerging talent and supporting long-term recruitment strategies. I’m continually learning how to build models, manage large datasets, and extract actionable insights while also improving in areas like data cleaning, storytelling, exploratory analysis, and model validation.\n\n\n🤝 Collaboration & Soft Skills\nThroughout my degree, I’ve participated in several collaborative, long-term group projects, including full-year assignments. These experiences have sharpened my abilities in:\n\nCommunication – actively listening, contributing effectively in teams\n\nTeamwork – navigating deadlines and sharing responsibilities\n\nProblem-Solving – tackling ambiguity and applying critical thinking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese soft skills are just as important as technical tools. Working closely with peers has taught me to communicate clearly, resolve conflicts, and deliver quality work in a team setting essential for real-world analytics roles.\n\n\n\n\n💬 Final Thought\n\n“Data will never replace intuition—but it can sharpen it.”\nBlending instinct with insight—for better decisions on and off the pitch."

    "text": "🔍 Why Reflection Matters\nReflection is one of the most powerful tools for long-term growth both personally and professionally. By looking back honestly at what went well, what could be improved, and what was learned, we create a feedback loop that sharpens our thinking and strengthens our skills. Being real with yourself is never easy, but it’s where meaningful progress begins. This page is an attempt to do just that: to step back and assess not just what I built, but what I learned in the process.\n\n\n\n⚽ Project 1: Predicting Breakout Footballers with Machine Learning\nWhat I learned:\nThis project taught me how to build and evaluate a complete machine learning pipeline from preprocessing and feature engineering to model selection and SHAP explainability. It showed me how complex real-world data can be and the importance of domain-specific labels.\nWhat went well / what didn’t:\nThe modeling stage and SHAP integration worked very smoothly, but cleaning the data and designing useful breakout labels were much more difficult than expected. It taught me that thoughtful definitions matter as much as model performance.\nSkills improved:\nFeature engineering Model evaluation XGBoost SHAP explainability Sports analytics\n\n\n\n📊 Project 2: Power BI Sales Dashboard\nWhat I learned:\nThis project deepened my understanding of how to transform raw business data into clear, actionable visual insights. It was my first time using Power BI at this scale.\nWhat went well / what didn’t:\nThe visuals and KPIs came together well, and I was especially proud of the product line analysis. However, connecting all filters correctly and managing relationships took longer than expected.\nSkills improved:\nDAX Power BI dashboarding Visual storytelling KPI tracking\n\n\n\n🛒 Project 3: SQL and Python for Retail Analytics\nWhat I learned:\nI learned how to structure SQL queries to answer real business questions and integrate that analysis into Python for visual output.\nWhat went well / what didn’t:\nWriting efficient SQL and connecting Python visualizations worked nicely. If I were to do it again, I would make the data more realistic and varied to simulate a larger database as this would provide more accurate results\nSkills improved:\nSQL joins Grouping and aggregation Matplotlib Python-based visual analytics\n\n\n\n🌐 Project 4: Web Scraping & Visualization of Tech Salaries\nWhat I learned:\nThis was my first time using BeautifulSoup to scrape websites. It showed me how data doesn’t always come clean and structured and how to handle it when it doesn’t.\nWhat went well / what didn’t:\nI was happy with the scraping logic and final plots. Some elements of HTML parsing were challenging and required trial-and-error and patience.\nSkills improved:\nBeautifulSoup scraping HTML parsing Seaborn Matplotlib\n\n\n\n🚀 Final Reflection\nLooking back, this portfolio has done more than just help me pass a module it has cemented my confidence in this career path. I began the year interested in data analysis and player recruitment. Now, I’m certain it’s what I want to do.\nMy understanding of the tools, techniques, and mindset required has grown dramatically. I now know that good analysts aren’t just technical they think critically, communicate clearly, and reflect honestly. Working in groups on multiple assignments, especially year-long ones, has helped me develop soft skills like\nCommunication Teamwork Problem-solving\n— the same ones that matter in real-world teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranching Decision\n\n\n\nWhile I initially intended to use multiple Git branches to separate distinct features of the portfolio, I encountered significant integration conflicts and time constraints while managing interdependent changes across pages. To maintain the integrity and consistency of the site, I made the decision to keep development on a unified branch. This ensured stability and allowed me to focus more on analysis, design polish, and storytelling—core goals of this portfolio. Each commit has been carefully documented for transparency and traceability.\n\n\n\n“Growth begins the moment we choose honesty over ego, and reflection over routine.”"
