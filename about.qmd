# 👋 About Me

My name is **Conor English**, and I’m a Business Studies student with a strong focus on analytics. I’m passionate about working as a **data analyst in elite sports environments**, particularly in **player recruitment** for professional teams in football, the NFL, or the NBA. I created this e-portfolio to showcase my capabilities across data analysis, machine learning, dashboarding, and SQL-driven insights—all applied through realistic, industry-inspired scenarios.

# 🎓 Academic & Technical Background

I’m studying **Business Studies** at Dublin City University with a specialism in **Analytics**, where I've completed modules in **machine learning, data management, and statistical modeling**. In addition to my degree, I’ve earned multiple certifications in **Python, Machine Learning, and SQL** through **DataCamp** and **Kubicle**.

# 🤝 Collaboration & Soft Skills

Throughout my degree, I’ve participated in several **collaborative, long-term group projects**, including full-year assignments. These experiences have sharpened my abilities in:
